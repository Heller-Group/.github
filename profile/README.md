## Welcome to the team of Heller Group üôå

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction

This is the GitHub organization for **Heller group** at Harvard. We share the codes and related projects in this space to collaborate together!

Currently we are focusing on developing the [Wave-on-Wave codes](https://github.com/Heller-Group/Wave-on-Wave) , and the which we hope to be a unified version that everyone can use to conduct simulation for quantum materials. We are also developing [superwire codes](https://github.com/Heller-Group/Superwire).

### üåà Contribution guidelines

The group is private and visible to every member here, and everyone can **commit** their codes to the repository. We suggest everyone [create a branch](https://github.com/Heller-Group/Wave-on-Wave/branches) with your name when making changes. 

We have a `main` branch which contains the major codes, and it will be updated usually. Feel free to make changes, 

1. If you just play with the code and don't want to commit your changes to the `main` branch, you can also **upload all your files** (In your branch click "Add file") to your own branch.  We will inform you of any updates, and we are happy to help you on sync with the new version of code!
2. If you find any bugs, or want something added in the code, please do not hesitate to [report issues here](https://github.com/Heller-Group/Wave-on-Wave/issues)!
3. If you want to commit anything to the main branch, e.g. a bug fixed or a new function, you can [pull requests](https://github.com/Heller-Group/Wave-on-Wave/pulls) to add your contribution in our main code!


### üë©‚Äçüíª Useful spaces

We also have a lot of common space in our group:
- [**Discussion**: Discuss anything like fun results in simulation here](https://github.com/orgs/Heller-Group/discussions)
- [**Project**: See the progress of our research projects here](https://github.com/orgs/Heller-Group/projects)
